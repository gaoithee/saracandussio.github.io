      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

**Hello there**, I'm Sara! 

I'm a first-year PhD student in Natural Language Processing at the University of Trieste (Italy), where I work within the [AI Lab](https://ai-lab.units.it/) under the supervision of [Luca Bortolussi](https://ai-lab.units.it/?page_id=139) and [Gabriele Sarti](https://gsarti.com/).

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. My Master's thesis explored how multi-agent systems can enhance the performance of extremely compact models on Question Answering tasks. ü§ù

My current research focuses on understanding the generalization abilities of large language models (LLMs), identifying their limitations, and exploring ways to encourage reasoning that goes beyond memorization. I'm particularly interested in Reinforcement Learning paradigms and Neuro-Symbolic integration. You can read more in my [recent paper accepted at ECML](arXiv:2507.07808). üß†

Outside of research, I‚Äôm the vice-president of the AI Student Society, and previously I worked as a research intern at [Rachael S.r.l.](https://rachael.swg.it/).
