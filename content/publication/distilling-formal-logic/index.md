abstract: >
  We introduce a framework for learning continuous neural representations of formal specifications by distilling the geometry of their semantics into a latent space. Using a teacher-student setup, we distill a symbolic robustness kernel into a Transformer encoder, supervised by a continuous kernel-weighted geometric alignment objective that penalizes errors proportionally to their semantic discrepancies.

Accepted at **NeSy 2026** as an oral presentation 🎉

## The Idea

Typical knowledge distillation compresses a big neural model into a smaller one. We do something different: our "expert" isn't a neural network at all — it's a **mathematical kernel built on top of formal logic**.

This kernel is provably correct: it captures the true meaning of logical formulas with mathematical guarantees. The problem? It's expensive to compute and doesn't scale.

So instead of distilling a big neural model into a smaller neural model, we **distill the geometric structure** (i.e. relative positions) of a symbolic kernel into a Transformer encoder. We're not compressing parameters — we're transferring mathematical meaning into neural space.

Using a teacher-student setup with a kernel-weighted geometric alignment objective, we train the encoder to mirror the semantic distances defined by the symbolic kernel. Errors are penalized proportionally to their semantic discrepancy — not just their magnitude.

## Why It Matters

The result is a model that:
- runs in a **single forward pass**
- produces **semantically faithful embeddings** of logical formulas
- can **reconstruct the original formula** from its embedding
- all without sacrificing the logical guarantees of the original kernel

This opens up scalable, trustworthy neuro-symbolic reasoning for domains where correctness and efficiency aren't optional:

- 🚗 Autonomous driving & robotics (real-time monitoring of safety specs)
- 🏥 Healthcare (checking patient signals against clinical guidelines)
- ⚙️ Cyber-physical systems (fast verification & control synthesis)

And beyond STL, this approach generalizes to **any domain with a meaningful but expensive similarity function** — think genomic sequences, molecular graphs, or structured data where semantics matter more than surface form.
